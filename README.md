<h2>Setup Cron</h2>
It is needed to enable the Magento cron. Make sure that this is running every minute.
We are using a cronjob to process the notifications. The cronjob will be executed every minute. It only executes the notifications that have been received at least 5 minutes ago. We have built in this 5 minutes so we are sure Magento has created the order and all save after events are executed.
A handy tool to get inside into your cronjobs is AOE scheduler. You can download this tool through <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/aoe-scheduler.html" target="_blank">Magento Connect</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AOEpeople/Aoe_Scheduler/releases">GitHub</a>

<h2>Support</h2>

<h2>Update script for 2.4.0 for Adyen OneClick users</h2>
In the new version of the module 2.4.0 the Recurring References are saved into the Billing Agreements of Magento.
If you already running the Adyen plugin that has version 2.3.1 or lower you need to import the already saved card data into your Magento store if you want to show OneClick to your current shoppers.

To import the current saved cards into billing agreements of Magento you need to manually execute the script by following these steps:
1. Go into your terminal
2. Go to the Magento home directory
3. Go inside the folder shell
4. Now execute the script by: php adyen.php -action loadBillingAgreements

All new saved cards will be automatically saved into billingAgreement of magento. Make sure you have turned on RECURRING_CONTRACT notification on your merchantAccount. If you want to add this or if you are not sure, just send us an email us magento@adyen.com.
